# useIsElementVisibleInScreen

Hook to know when the user has reached the bottom of the scroll of a specific element.

```ts
import { useIsElementVisibleInScreen } from '@pidedirecto/ui/hooks';

const elementRefInitializer = useIsElementVisibleInScreen({
    onVisible: () => {},
});

<div ref={elementRefInitializer}></div>
```

This hook returns a function that will initialize the ref inside the hook, so you should pass this function to the ref prop of the component
you want to track. This is not a React ref, so you should not use it like that.

As parameter the hook accepts an object with three keys:

-   `onVisible` a callback that will be called each time the element toggles its visibility, which means if it is visible or not in the screen.
-   `threshold` a number value from 0 to 1, which means how much percent of the element should be visible to trigger the callback,
    by default its 1, in other words, 100% of the element should be visible in the screen.
-   `rootElement` the root element to check the intersection by default it is the window.
