# useNotification

`useNotification` hook returns a function that you can call to show notifications.

The basic usage for using this hook is first importing the Notifications component and put it somewhere in your applications,
commonly in the application main component

```tsx
import { Notificatons } from '@pidedirecto/ui'


return (
    <Notifications />
)
```

We strongly recommend importing and using only one `Notifications` component per application, having 2 instances of this component
could lead to unexpected behaviours.

Once you have imported the `Notifications` component, you can use the `useNotification` hook anywhere in your application and start showing notifications.

```tsx
import { useNotification } from '@pidedirecto/ui/hooks'
import { Button } from '@pidedirecto/ui'

function Component() {
    const notification = useNotification()

    const handleClick = () => {
        notification({ message: 'Hi! You have a new notification' })
    }

    return (
        <Button onClick={handleClick}>Click me!</Button>
    )
}
```

<Canvas of={NotificationsStories.Primary} sourceState='none' />

# API
