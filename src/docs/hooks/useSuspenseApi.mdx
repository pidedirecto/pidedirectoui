# useSuspenseApi

This hook allows you to call apis but suspending the component.

```tsx
import { useSuspenseApi } from '@pidedirecto/ui/hooks';

const [response, loadApi] = useSuspenseApi(findElementsApi, { ...request });
```

The `useSuspenseApi` accepts three arguments.

1. The first argument is an api function, this function should return an `ApiSauceResponse`.
2. The second argument is the api request object
3. The third argument is an object of options

This hook should always be used in a component wrapped inside the `Suspense` component from Rect. example:

```tsx
import { useSuspenseApi } from '@pidedirecto/ui/hooks';
import { Suspense } from 'react';

function App() {
    return (
        <Suspense fallback='Loading...'>
            <Elements />
        </Suspense>
    );
}

function Elements() {
    const [elements] = useSuspenseApi(findElementsApi, {});

    return elements.map((element) => <span>{element}</span>);
}
```

The `Suspense` component will know when the api is being called and will render the `fallback` prop instead, this is specially useful
for components that need to call an api when it is mounted.

The main difference between suspending a component instead of showing a loading indicator manually with states, is that React avoids to renders
the component meanwhile the api is being called. You can read more about `Suspense` [here](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense).

## Options

The `options` object can have the following attributes

-   `onError` function, this functions is going to be called when the api call has failed, this function receives 2 arguments

    1. The first argument is the response from the api and its type is

```ts
type ApiErrorResponse = {
    ok: false;
    data?: {
        message?: string;
        name?: string;
    };
    status?: number;
    problem: 'CLIENT_ERROR' | 'SERVER_ERROR' | 'TIMEOUT_ERROR' | 'CONNECTION_ERROR' | 'NETWORK_ERROR' | 'CANCEL_ERROR';
};
```

    2. The second argument is a function to change the value of the api response

-   `requiredValues` array, this field is used to prevent the api is called with some nullish values, if the api request requires some values but
    the values you passed are probably undefined, you can pass them to this array to assure those values are defined before calling the api, for example:

```ts
import { useSuspenseApi } from '@pidedirecto/ui/hooks';

const [userSelection, setUserSelection] = useState(undefined);

const [response] = useSuspenseApi(someApi, { userSelection }, { requiredValues: [userSelection] });

const handleSelect = (selectedValue) => setUserSelection(selectedValue);
```

In this example we have an state that has been initialized as undefined, cause its value depends on a user selection, if we would like to call an api
that need the user selection inside the request but the api required that value to be defined, we can pass the `userSelection` state to the
`requiredValues` array to guarantee that the api is called once that value has been defined.

-   `unZip`, this field is used to unzip the api response.

## Result

The `useSuspenseApi` hook, returns 3 values

1. The second value is the api response, when the api has been called and everything went ok, the hook will change this value to the api response,
   you can set the default value with the `options` object.

**NOTE**

This value is already a state, so you don't need to set other state based on this value

Do

```tsx
const [elements] = useSuspenseApi(findElementsApi, { ...request });

return (
    <div>
        // You can use directly the response
        {elements.map(element => <span>{element}</span>)}
    </div>
)
```

Don't

```tsx

const [elementsResponse, setElementsResponse] = useState([])

const [elements] = useSuspenseApi(findElementsApi, { ...request });

useEffect(() => {
    // You don't need to set another state based on the useSuspenseApi result, IT IS ALREADY A STATE!
    setElementsResponse(elements)
}, [elements])

return (
    <div>
        {elementsResponse.map(element => <span>{element}</span>)}
    </div>
)
```

3. The third value is a function to call again the api at any time, this is useful for "refresh" behaviors, this function can receive a new request to call the api,
   you need to pass the request inside an object, for example

```tsx
const [elements, loadApi] = useSuspenseApi(findElementsApi, { ...request });

const handleClick = () => {
    // Here we can send the new request
    loadApi({ request: { ...newRequest } })

    // Or we can just call it, this will use the request set in the hook declaration
    loadApi()
}

return (
    <div>
        <button onClick={handleClick}>Refresh</button>
        // You can use directly the response cause it is already a value
        {elements.map(element => <span>{element}</span>)}
    </div>
)
```
