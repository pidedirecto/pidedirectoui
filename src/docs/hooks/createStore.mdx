# createStore

Creates a store with initial state and actions

```tsx
import { createStore } from '@pidedirecto/ui/hooks'


export const [useNumbersStore, useNumbersAction] = createStore<State, Actions>({
    initialState: {
        numbers: []
    },
    actions: {
        addNumber: (state, number) => {
            state.numbers.push(number)
        }
    }
})

type State = {
    numbers: Array<number>
}

type Actions = {
    addNumber: (n: number) => void
}
```

## useStore

The first value returned by the `createStore` function is a `useStore` hook that will retrieve the value you want to get from state,
using the previous example if you would like to get the `numbers` state from the store you should use `useNumbersStore` like

```tsx
const numbers = useNumbersStore(state => state.numbers)
```

The `useStore` hook expects a function as parameter, inside this function you will have to return what values you want from state.

We recommend naming this hook with this format `use...anyNameHere...Store`

## useAction

The second value is a `useAction` function that will retrieve the action from the store you want to do,
using the previous example if you would like to call the `addNumber` action you should do it as follows

```tsx
const addNumber = useNumbersAction(actions => actions.addNumber)

const handleClick = () => {
    addNumber(1)
}
```

The `useAction` expects a function as parameter, inside this function you will have to return what action you want from state.

We recommend naming this hook with this format `use...anyNameHere...Action`

## logs

If you try to console.log directly the state of the store inside an action you will find it difficult to read because the store state is wrapped into proxies,
so if you want to console log the state you will have to use the [logStore](https://ui.pidedirecto.mx/?path=/docs/utils-logstore--docs) function
