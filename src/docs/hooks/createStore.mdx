# createStore

Creates a store with initial state and actions

```tsx
import { createStore } from '@pidedirecto/ui/hooks';

export const [useNumbersStore, useNumbersAction] = createStore<State, Actions>({
    initialState: {
        numbers: [],
    },
    actions: {
        addNumber: (state, number) => {
            state.numbers.push(number);
        },
    },
});

type State = {
    numbers: Array<number>;
};

type Actions = {
    addNumber: (n: number) => void;
};
```

## useStore

The first value returned by the `createStore` function is a `useStore` hook that will retrieve the value you want to get from state,
using the previous example if you would like to get the `numbers` state from the store you should use `useNumbersStore` like

```tsx
const numbers = useNumbersStore((state) => state.numbers);
```

The `useStore` hook expects a function as parameter, inside this function you will have to return what values you want from state.

We recommend naming this hook with this format `use...anyNameHere...Store`

## useAction

The second value is a `useAction` function that will retrieve the action from the store you want to do,
using the previous example if you would like to call the `addNumber` action you should do it as follows

```tsx
const addNumber = useNumbersAction((actions) => actions.addNumber);

const handleClick = () => {
    addNumber(1);
};
```

The `useAction` expects a function as parameter, inside this function you will have to return what action you want from state.

We recommend naming this hook with this format `use...anyNameHere...Action`

## Persist

If you would like your data persist event if the user closes thr browser, you can use persist param. When persisting the data
will be saved into the browser indexed db.

```ts
export const [useNumbersStore, useNumbersAction] = createStore<State, Actions>({
    initialState: {
        numbers: [],
    },
    actions: {
        addNumber: (state, number) => {
            state.numbers.push(number);
        },
    },
    persist: true,
    storeName: 'numbers',
});
```

When passing persist true, it will ask for a second parameter named `storeName`, this will be the name of the db in the browser.
Have in mind that when persisting the action now have to sync the information to the database, therefore actions now can throw errors
if there is a problem within the database, so the recommendation is handling the errors for actions if you found there has been issues.

```ts
const addNumber = useNumbersAction((actions) => actions.addNumber);

const handleAddNumber = async () => {
    try {
        addNumber(1);
    } catch (e) {
        // Do something with the error
    }
};
```

If you would like to learn more about indexed db in the browser you can check the [docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API).

## logs

If you try to console.log directly the state of the store inside an action you will find it difficult to read because the store state is wrapped into proxies,
so if you want to console log the state you will have to use the [logStore](https://ui.pidedirecto.mx/?path=/docs/utils-logstore--docs) function
