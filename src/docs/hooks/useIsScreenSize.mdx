# useIsScreenSize

Hook to know if current screen width is of specific size.

```tsx
import { useIsScreenSize } from '@pidedirecto/ui/hooks'
import { ScreenSizes } from '@pidedirecto/ui/constants'

const isSmallScreen = useIsScreenSize(ScreenSizes.SMALL_SCREEN)
```

In order to use this hook you have to use the `ScreenSizes` const.

Try to avoid to use this hook for styling purposes, instead try to use always CSS 2media queries.
