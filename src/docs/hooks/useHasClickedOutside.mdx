# useHasClickedOutside

Hook to know if a user has clicked outside a specific element.

```tsx
import { useHasClickedOutside } from '@pidedirecto/ui/hooks'

const elementRef = useRef(null)
useHasClickedOutside({
    element: elementRef,
    onClick: ({ hasClickedOutside, element }) => console.log(hasClickedOutside)
})

return (
    <div ref={elementRef}>content</div>
)
```

The hook needs an `element` to know if the click event on the page has been outside of it,
we recommend using React refs to get the HTML element, but it can also be gotten with the document.getElement method.

To listen to the onClick event you have to pass the `onClick` callback, it will be called each time the user clicks on the page.
The onClick callback receives 2 arguments: `hasClickedOutside` a boolean value to know if the click has been done outside the element, and `element` which is the HTML element clicked.
