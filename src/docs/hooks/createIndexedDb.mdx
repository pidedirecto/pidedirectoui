# createIndexedDb

Creates store where the data is saved in the browser indexed db

```tsx
import { createIndexedDb } from '@pidedirecto/ui/hooks';

const actions = createIndexedDb<State>({
    name: 'ordersStore',
    initialState: {
        orders: [],
        number: 0,
        selectedOrderId: undefined,
    },
});
```

`createIndexedDb` function takes an object as argument, this object needs the following properties:

-   `name`: This key accepts a string value, this will be the name for the indexed db in the browser, this MUST be unique between the different
    indexed util functions, if you have multiple indexed util functions with the same name you will write to the same db on different places
    which may cause unexpected behaviours.

-   `initialState`: The initial state of the db, if it is the first time an indexed db is created the initial state will
    be populated, if data is already saved then the initial state will be omitted, in other words, the initial state is only
    used when the db has not been created if it is already then the store value will be the values in the db.

## Usage

The `createdIndexedDb` function returns an object containing the actions for update and get the state, so for every state you
define in the initialState param there will be two actions in the object.

```ts
async function incrementByOne() {
    const value = actions.getNumber(); // It returns the current number value in the indexed db
    updateNumber(value + 1); // It updates the number value in the indexed db
}
```

## Notes

-   You may ask what are the difference between `createdIndexedDb` and `createStore` with persist param, well the `createStore`
    function creates hooks, so you can use them and access the indexed db from components, if you change a value with that function
    the components will know and will re-render. The `createdIndexedDb` function only creates the actions, so you can modify the
    indexed db, you can, of course, use these actions inside components, but besides that, you will be able to use them outside of them.

    So our recommendation of when tou use each function, is if you will have to access the db outside of React components, use
    `createdIndexedDb`, and if you want the components re-render to changes on the indexed db use `createStore`.

    Have in mind not to access to the same db from `createdIndexedDb` and `createStore` because you may have unexpected
    behaviours.

-   Changing the state of an existing object store can cause problems, remember the user may already have data stored in the db
    and changing it may cause problems. This can be avoided by just creating a new indexed store or a new state.

-   Actions can throw errors, so handle them if needed, the action can throw an error for different reasons, problems in the db,
    user not granting the permissions to use indexed dbs, or simply if the browser does not support them.
