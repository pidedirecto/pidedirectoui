# useLoadApi

This hook allows you to call apis.

```tsx
import { useLoadApi } from '@pidedirecto/ui/hooks';

const elementRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement | null>(null);

const [loading, response, loadApi] = useLoadApi(findElementsApi, { ...request });
```

The `useLoadApi` accepts three arguments.

1. The first argument is an api function, this function should return an `ApiSauceResponse`.
2. The second argument is the api request object
3. The third argument is an object of options

## Options

The `options` object can have the following attributes

-   `initialValue` can be any type, this value is used to set the default value of the response result
-   `onError` function, this functions is going to be called when the api call has failed, this function receives 2 arguments

    1. The first argument is the response from the api and its type is

```ts
type ApiErrorResponse = {
    ok: false;
    data?: {
        message?: string;
        name?: string;
    };
    status?: number;
    problem: 'CLIENT_ERROR' | 'SERVER_ERROR' | 'TIMEOUT_ERROR' | 'CONNECTION_ERROR' | 'NETWORK_ERROR' | 'CANCEL_ERROR';
};
```

    2. The second argument is a function to change the value of the api response

-   `dependencies` array, this array works the same as the dependencies array from the `useEffect` hook, if inside the request
    you use some external state, or you want to call the api each time an state changes, you must pass it to this array, for example:

```ts
import { useLoadApi } from '@pidedirecto/ui/hooks';

const [page, setPage] = useState(1);

const [loading, response] = useLoadApi(paginationApi, { page }, { dependencies: [page] });
```

In this example how the api request uses the page state, you should pass it in the dependencies array

-   `requiredValues` array, this field is used to prevent the api is called with some nullish values, if the api request requires some values but
    the values you passed are probably undefined, you can pass them to this array to assure those values are defined before calling the api, for example:

```ts
import { useLoadApi } from '@pidedirecto/ui/hooks';

const [userSelection, setUserSelection] = useState(undefined);

const [loading, response] = useLoadApi(someApi, { userSelection }, { requiredValues: [userSelection], dependencies: [userSelection] });

const handleSelect = (selectedValue) => setUserSelection(selectedValue);
```

In this example we have an state that has been initialized as undefined, cause its value depends on a user selection, if we would like to call an api
that need the user selection inside the request but the api required that value to be defined, we can pass the `userSelection` state to the
`requiredValues` array to guarantee that the api is called once that value has been defined.

-   `unZip`, this field is used to unzip the api response.

## Result

The `useLoadApi` hook, returns 3 values

1. The first value is a loading state, when the api is being called this state will indicate it.
2. The second value is the api response, when the api has been called and everything went ok, the hook will change this value to the api response,
   you can set the default value with the `options` object.

**NOTE**

This value is already a state, so you don't need to set other state based on this value

Do

```tsx
const [loading, elements] = useLoadApi(findElementsApi, { ...request });

return (
    <div>
        // You can use directly the response
        {elements.map(element => <span>{element}</span>)}
    </div>
)
```

Don't

```tsx

const [elementsResponse, setElementsResponse] = useState([])

const [loading, elements] = useLoadApi(findElementsApi, { ...request });

useEffect(() => {
    // You don't need to set another state based on the useLoadApi result, IT IS ALREADY A STATE!
    setElementsResponse(elements)
}, [elements])

return (
    <div>
        {elementsResponse.map(element => <span>{element}</span>)}
    </div>
)
```

3. The third value is a function to call again the api at any time, this is useful for "refresh" behaviors, this function can receive a new request to call the api,
   you need to pass the request inside an object, for example

```tsx
const [loading, elements, loadApi] = useLoadApi(findElementsApi, { ...request });

const handleClick = () => {
    // Here we can send the new request
    loadApi({ request: { ...newRequest } })

    // Or we can just call it, this will use the request set in the hook declaration
    loadApi()
}

return (
    <div>
        <button onClick={handleClick}>Refresh</button>
        // You can use directly the response cause it is already a value
        {elements.map(element => <span>{element}</span>)}
    </div>
)
```
