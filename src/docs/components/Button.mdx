# Button

Renders a Button

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Primary} />

## onClick event

To listen to the onClick it is as simple as passing an `onClick` prop with a function as a value, the function can be synchronous or asynchronous.

```tsx

const handleClick = () => console.log('Hi!!');

<Button onClick={handleClick}>button</Button>
```


## Button variants
The primary variant is the main one, you don't have to pass anything to the button to render this version

### Secondary
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Secondary} />

You can change the secondary button through the theme

### Outline
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Outline} />

You can change the outline button through the theme

### Text
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Text} />

### Icon
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Icon} />


## API
Here there are described some of the custom props, but the `Button` component can receive almost any of the HTML input props.

<ArgTypes of={ButtonStories} />
