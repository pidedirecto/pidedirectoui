# Accordion
Renders an accordion.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Primary} />

The accordion has 2 different ways of using, first you can pass a title and it will automatically render a heading for the accordion content, this usage is in the example shown before.

You may also want the functionality of the accordion without the default header, to do this you can control it using the `open` and `onChange` props, but you have to remove the title prop.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Controlled} sourceState={'none'} />

```tsx
const [accordionState, setAccordionState] = useState(false);

const toggleAccordion = () => setAccordionState(!accordionState);

return (
    <div>
        <Button onClick={toggleAccordion}>Click me to toggle the content!</Button>
        <Accordion open={accordionState} onChange={toggleAccordion}>
            <p>Hi! I'm hidden inside an accordion</p>
        </Accordion>
    </div>
);
```

## Customization

- Custom left icon

By default, the accordion show an up and down arrow to indicate the accordion state, this can be customizable passing the `renderIcon` prop, this prop is a function that can return any react node and will receive as a prop the accordion state.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.CustomIcon} sourceState={'none'} />

```tsx
<Accordion title={'This is an accordion'} renderIcon={accordionState => (accordionState ? 'Close me!' : 'Open me!')}>
    <p>Hi! I'm hidden inside an accordion</p>
</Accordion>
```

- Subtext

You can also add a description/subtitle to the accordion

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Subtext} />
