# Table
Renders a table

<Canvas of={TableStories.Primary} />

## Columns

### id
This is the column id, this is important because this will be the link between the column and the row, with this id you can tell to the component what should be rendered on this column

### content
This is the column header content, in other words the children of `th`, this content can be any valid React.Node, can be just a string or a React element

### size
This is the column size, this is optional and by default this has a value of 1, if you set a value of `2` means this column will grow in 200%

```tsx
const columns = [
    {
        id: 'column1',
        content: 'This is the header 1'
    },
    {
        id: 'column2',
        content: (
            <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>This is the header 2</span>
        )
    },
    {
        id: 'column3',
        content: 'This is the header 3',
        size: 2,
    },
]
```

## Rows

This prop is an array of objects, each object should have one key per column, the key should be one of the ids defined in the columns array, for example, if you define a column with id `status`
```tsx
const column = {
    id: 'column1',
    content: 'Column 1'
}
```
You should have objects inside the rows array with the key `status`, thus you tell what should be rendered in the column by the value of the key `status`, the value can be any React node
```tsx
const rows = [
    {
        column1: 'Cell 1'
    },
    {
        column1: <div>Cell 2</div>
    }
]
```

## Table interaction

If you want to know when the user clicks somewhere in the table you can do it with 2 different ways. You can know when the user clicks on a row by the `onRowClick` prop,
this function will be called each time the user clicks on a row and will receive the row info you provided

<Canvas of={TableStories.RowClick} />

If you want to know when the user clicks on a cell or add more functionality to cells, you can pass whatever you want as cell content

<Canvas of={TableStories.CellClick} />

### Pagination

To enable the pagination you have to pass the `rowsPerPage` prop indicating how many rows are going to be shown per page

<Canvas of={TableStories.Pagination} />

### Search

To enable the search input you have to pass the `searchable` prop, this will show an input, in order to indicate that a row matches the query of the input you have to pass a `onSearch` key in the row object.
The `onSearch` function will receive a query argument of type string and will expect a boolean response.

For example in the next table searche for row 1, row 2 and row 3

<Canvas of={TableStories.SearchableTable} />

### Virtualized

To enable virtualization in `Table` you need to pass `virtualized` prop, also you have to pass `contentHeight` and `rowHeight`,
both indicating the table body height and table rows height respectively

<Canvas of={TableStories.Virtualized} />

### Selectable

`Table` component can have selectable rows, to do this you have to pass `selectable` prop and `onSelect` prop, the `onSelect` callback prop
will be called each time the users selects or deselects a row, for this is also important to pass `rowId` to the row object

<Canvas of={TableStories.Selectable} />

### Customization

The `Table` component has customizable props. `title` prop will render a title.

<Canvas of={TableStories.CustomToolbar} />

`tooltbar` prop can receive either a function or directly a `React.Element` value, if a function is passed this function should return a `React.Element`, and as argument will receive an object.
```ts
{
    selectedRows: Array<any>;
    clearSelectedRows: () => void;
}
```
The `selectedRows` key is an array containing the `rowId` values of the selected rows, so in order to use this functionality you should pass to each row object an unique value in the `rowId` field.
The `clearSelectedRows` functions can be used to clear the selected rows.

```tsx
import { RefreshIcon } from '@pidedirecto/ui/icons'
import { Table, Button } from '@pidedirecto/ui'

<Table
    ...
    toolbar={(
        <Button>
            <RefreshIcon />
        </Button>
    )}
/>

```

or

```tsx
import { TrashCanIcon } from '@pidedirecto/ui/icons'
import { Table, Button } from '@pidedirecto/ui'

<Table
    ...
    selectable
    toolbar={({ selectedRows }) => (
        <Button onClick={() => removeItems(selectedRows)}>
            <TrashCanIcon />
        </Button>
    )}
/>

```
