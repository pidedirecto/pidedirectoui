# Components zIndex

The `z-index` css property is very important, special for those components that area shown above others, like dialogs and dropdowns,
that's why we have defined them here so you can use this as a reference for future components or any other development.

The values described here are the zIndexes used by our components:

- `Dialog` container and its background: 1000
- `Dialog` content card: 1100
- `DropwDown`: 1500
- `Tooltip`: 1500
- `Autocomplete`: 1500
- `Notification`: 3000
