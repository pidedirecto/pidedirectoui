# Radio

Renders a radio button

<Canvas of={RadioStories.Primary} />

In contrast with the checkbox component, a radio button cannot be unchecked by itself, it will need to be in company with more radio buttons,
to group radio buttons you should use the `RadioGroup` component.

## API

Here there are described some of the important props, but the `Radio` component can receive almost any of the HTML input props.
