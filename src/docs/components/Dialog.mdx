# Dialog
Renders a Dialog.

<Canvas of={DialogStories.Primary} sourceState='none' />

```tsx
import { Dialog, Buttom } from '@pidedirecto/ui'

const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)

return (
    <div>
        <Button onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>Open Dialog</Button>
        <Dialog open={open} onClose={() => setOpen(false)}>
            This is the dialog content
        </Dialog>
    </div>
)
```

## Positions

The `Dialog` component can be positioned in 5 different ways around the window, by default the dialog is centered in the screen,
but it can also be positioned in the 4 edges of the screen by passing the `position` prop.

- top
<Canvas of={DialogStories.TopDialog} sourceState='none' />

- right
<Canvas of={DialogStories.RightDialog} sourceState='none' />

- bottom
<Canvas of={DialogStories.BottomDialog} sourceState='none' />

- left
<Canvas of={DialogStories.LeftDialog} sourceState='none' />

## Dialog mounting

By default, when the dialog is closed it is removed from the DOM so the next time it opens it will have to be mounted again,
this can be problematic if mounting the content of the dialog is expensive in terms of computing or rendering, if you want to keep mounted the dialog and its content
all the time you can achieve this by passing the prop `keepMounted`.
