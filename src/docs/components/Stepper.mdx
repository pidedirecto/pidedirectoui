# Stepper

Renders an stepper.

<Canvas of={StepperStories.Primary} />

The 2 main props of `Stepper` component are `steps` and `activeStep`. The `steps` prop is an array of `Step` objects. The `Step` object has the following properties.

-   `value`: Step value, this can be any value type and should be unique between steps.
-   `label`: Step label, a string value which will label the step
-   `content`: Step icon content, by default the icon content will be the index position of the step, you can change this content with this property, for example:

<Canvas of={StepperStories.CustomIcons} />

The `activeStep` prop should be the value of the step that is active, so the value passed here be one of the steps.

The position of the steps in the ui will correspond to its index position in the array.

## Orientation

You can change the stepper orientation to horizontal with the `orientation` prop.

<Canvas of={StepperStories.Horizontal} />
